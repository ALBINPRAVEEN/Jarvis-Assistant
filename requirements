#Pyperclip
pip install pyperclip
On Windows, no additional modules are needed.
On Mac, this module makes use of the pbcopy and pbpaste commands, which should come with the os.
On Linux, this module makes use of the xclip or xsel commands, which should come with the os. Otherwise run "sudo apt-get install xclip" or "sudo apt-get install xsel" (Note: xsel does not always seem to work.)
Otherwise on Linux, you will need the gtk or PyQt4 modules installed.
